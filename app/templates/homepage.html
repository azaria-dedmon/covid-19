        Covid-19 is a highly infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
        This illness spreads with ease through close contact (within 6ft),
        exposure to respiratory droplets and has also been declared as airborne.
        At this point, most of us are knowledgeable on the disease and it's symtpoms,
        but as a reminder, if you are experiencing:
        <span id='symptoms'>
            Fever or chills,
            New loss of smell,
            Cough or
            Shortness of breath
        </span>
        please seek medical attention immediately. Although this list is not exhaustive of
        symptoms caused by Covid, it is meant to give a general idea of what to look out for.
